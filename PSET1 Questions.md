Question 4:

Calculationg Variance.... ANSWER: "Between 1,764 and 1,765"
^^ Population v Sample????



Q6 --> Seemed like a 'trick' to teach us a formula to then not use it.
 I personally avoid joking and tricking poeple so I struggle with these questions.
 Should I expect questions like this often?


Q7 --> I entirely do not understand.

Based on the Yes-No questions in the lecture, but the answer is wrong.

If the "test" outlined in the lecutre is incorrect, would it be more reasonable to say unless it's clearly an ENTIRE POPULATION all formula should be for the Sample of a population?
